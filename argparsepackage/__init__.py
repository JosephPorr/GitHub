# To create a package we need to have a directory with our package name 
# that includes a __init__.py.  This is used as a placeholder for
# the src.  The __init__.py files are required to make Python treat the 
# directories as containing packages; this is done to prevent directories 
# with a common name, such as string, from unintentionally hiding valid 
# modules that occur later on the module search path.
