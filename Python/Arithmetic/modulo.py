# The result of the operator is a remainder left after the integer division.
# In other words, it's the value left over after dividing one value by another to produce an integer quotient.

 print(14 % 4) 

 # 14 / 4 is 3 with a remander of 2, like  3 X 4 = 12, then 14 - 12 = 2

# 14 // 4 gives 3 → this is the integer quotient;
# 3 * 4 gives 12 → as a result of quotient and divisor multiplication;
# 14 - 12 gives 2 → this is the remainder.
