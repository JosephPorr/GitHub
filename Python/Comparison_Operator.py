# becoming familiar with the the input() function;
# becoming familiar with comparison operators in Python.

#Using one of the comparison operators in Python, 
# write a simple two-line program that takes the parameter n as input, 
# which is an integer, and prints False if n is less than 100, 
# and True if n is greater than or equal to 100.

n = int(input("Enter a value for n: "))
